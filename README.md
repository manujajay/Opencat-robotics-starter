# Opencat Robotics Starter

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for beginners to start building and programming their own robotic cat using the Opencat framework. It includes instructions for hardware assembly, software installation, and basic programming.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- Servo motors
- Battery and power supply
- Basic mechanical parts for the robotic cat (can be 3D printed)
- Arduino IDE

## Installation

### Hardware Assembly

1. Assemble the mechanical parts of the robotic cat based on the Opencat design.
2. Install the servo motors at the designated joints.
3. Connect the servo motors to the Arduino using a servo driver shield.

### Software Installation

1. Install the Arduino IDE from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Download and install the necessary libraries for controlling the servo motors.

## Basic Usage Example

### Programming Basic Movements

The following Arduino sketch demonstrates how to control the servo motors to make the robotic cat walk.

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo servo1;  // Create servo object to control the first servo

void setup() {
  servo1.attach(9);  // Attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
  servo1.write(90);  // Set servo to mid-point
}

void loop() {
  servo1.write(180);  // Turn servo to one side
  delay(1000);        // Wait for a second
  servo1.write(0);    // Turn servo to the other side
  delay(1000);        // Wait for a second
}
```
